AboutAbout
I'm Chip Huyen, a writer and computer scientist. I'm building infrastructure or real-time ML. I also teach Machine Learning Systems Design at Stanford.

Previously, I was with Snorkel AI, NVIDIA, Netflix, Primer, Baomoi.com (acquired by VNG). I helped launch Coc Coc - Vietnam‚Äôs second most popular web browser with 20+ million monthly active users.

In my free time, I travel and write. After high school, I went to Brunei for a 3-day vacation which turned into a 3-year trip through Asia, Africa, and South America. During my trip, I worked as a Bollywood extra, a casino hostess, and a street performer.

I‚Äôm the author of four bestselling Vietnamese books. I‚Äôm working on an English book on machine learning interviews.I'm Chip Huyen, a writer and computer scientist.

    OMG I'M SO HAPPY!!!

    "Designing Machine Learning Systems" is finally out!

    Thanks everyone who helped me make this happen üôè üéâ

    The book Designing Machine Learning Systems is finally out!

PostPost
I‚Äôm excited to share that I‚Äôm working on a new book about building applications with foundation models. AI Engineering builds upon Machine Learning Systems Design, but with a focus on large scale, ready made models.

The book covers:
- The new AI stack (e.g. how it differs from traditional ML engineering)
- Different approaches to evaluate open-ended systems
- Dataset engineering
- Prompt engineering, RAG, agents
- Finetuning
- Compute infrastructure, including how to mitigate latency and cost

AI Engineering is scheduled for late 2024. An early draft of the first 3 chapters are available on the O'Reilly platform: https://lnkd.in/geh2x4Tw

I‚Äôve learned a lot during the research and writing process for this book. I hope you‚Äôll find the learnings useful. Feedback is much appreciated!

To understand the open source AI landscape, I went through the most popular AI repositories on GitHub, categorized them, and studied their growth trajectories. Here are some of the learnings:

https://lnkd.in/exR-PGZX

1. There are 845 generative AI repos with at least 500 stars on GitHub. They are built with contributions from over 20,000 developers, making almost a million commits.

2. I divided the AI stack into four layers: application, application development, model development, and infrastructure. The application and application development layers have seen the most growth in 2023. The infrastructure layer remains more or less the same. Some categories that have seen the most growth include AI interface, inference optimization, and prompt engineering.

3. The landscape exploded in late 2022 but seems to have calmed down since September 2023.

4. While big companies still dominate the landscape, there‚Äôs a rise in massively popular software hosted by individuals. Several have speculated that there will soon be billion-dollar one-person companies.

5. China's open source ecosystem is rapidly growing. 6 out of 20 GitHub accounts with the most popular AI repos originate in China, with two from Tsinghua University and two from Shanghai AI Lab.

New post: Building LLM applications for production

Link: https://lnkd.in/gi6aKZyJ

I spent the last month talking with companies who are building applications on top of LLMs and realized: it‚Äôs easy to build something cool with LLMs, but very hard to build something production-ready with LLMs.

There are several challenges that make productionizing LLM applications hard:

1. The ambiguity of natural languages can make for a delightful user experience but a painful developer experience.

2. The stochastic nature of LLMs can lead to inconsistency in user experience and silent failures.

3. How fast things are evolving makes it very hard to make business decisions: analysis on cost-latency, build (using open source) vs. buy (using paid APIs), prompting vs. finetuning vs. newer techniques needs to be done constantly.

This post discusses these challenges, and what companies are doing to address them. I also discuss more complex applications involving task composability, agent, and control flows.

    In the last year, I‚Äôve talked to ~30 companies in different industries about their challenges with real-time machine learning. I‚Äôve also worked with quite a few to find the solutions. This post outlines the solutions for (1) online prediction and (2) continual learning, with step-by-step use cases, considerations, and technologies required for each level.In the last year, I‚Äôve talked to ~30 companies in different industries about their challenges with real-time machine learning.

Hello Australia ü¶ò üëã I'll be in Sydney, Perth, Melbourne, and Auckland for the next two weeks speaking about data and AI. I'll be sharing the stage with Joe Reis ü§ì Eevamaija Virtanen Zach Wilson Adi Polak and many more wonderful data folks. If you're around, please say hi! I've heard wonderful things about the tech community here, and can't wait to get to know you. This is my first time in both countries. What must I eat/do/see? Thanks Peter Hanssens and DataEngBytes for inviting me.

Building a platform for generative AI applications Link: https://lnkd.in/gDUcwQ-v After studying how companies deploy generative AI applications, I noticed many similarities in their platforms. This post outlines these common components, what they do, and implementation considerations. This post starts from the simplest architecture and progressively add more components. 1. Enhance context input into a model by giving the model access to external data sources and tools for information gathering. 2. Put in guardrails to protect your system and your users. 3. Add model router and gateway to support complex pipelines and add more security. 4. Optimize for latency and costs with cache. 5. Add complex logic and write actions to maximize your system‚Äôs capabilities. I try my best to keep the architecture general, but certain applications might deviate. As always, feedback is appreciated! #mlengineering #genai #aiapplications
