    New IDE has been released for Shreya Shankar's DocETL product. Starting to look snazzy. Even if you never use this in a production, I think it's valuable to start getting familiar with these types of tools, because we're going to see a deluge of great ones as soon as the UX pattern gets going and familiarized.

Excited that our DocETL preprint, titled "Agentic Query Rewriting and Evaluation for Complex Document Processing", led by Shreya Shankar — is out!! I'm particularly stoked about our 13 new rewrite "directives"—like rewrite rules, but more abstract—all entirely instantiated by LLM agents to rewrite pipelines into alternatives. All of these alternatives are evaluated by LLMs as well. To me, this work represents a great example of combining the best of what the DB and AI communities has to offer: declarative query specification + a methodical exploration of the search space to find performant (here mostly accuracy) query plans, coupled with LLM agents to instantiate and evaluate the query plans. Take a look and let us know what you think!!

LLMs have made exciting progress on hard tasks! But they still struggle to analyze complex, unstructured documents. We (at UC Berkeley) built DocETL, an open-source, low-code system for LLM-powered data processing: https://lnkd.in/g9-ZGwG3 See our demo: https://www.docetl.com/ GitHub repo: https://lnkd.in/g6zMJpFf Documentation: https://lnkd.in/gWQKdebq, US Presidential Debate Analysis, docetl.com
