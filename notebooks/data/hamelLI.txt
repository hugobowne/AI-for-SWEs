AboutAbout
I enjoy building tools and platforms to make ML more accessible. I have authored and am a core maintainer of many popular open source tools: https://hamel.dev/oss/opensource.html Furthermore, I have extensive experience (20+ years) as a machine learning engineer across a wide variety of industries.

I am currently helping people operationalize LLM models. I worked on GitHub Copilot, a large language model deployed at scale used by over 100M developers, as well as pre-cursors to Copilot like CodeSearchNet.

I often hear that evals are the most confusing part of creating LLM AI products. It's a shame b/c IMO, domain-specific evals are the most important part of an AI product! I've written a detailed blog post with real examples on how to do this https://lnkd.in/gXf9afPV
Your AI Product Needs Evals –

    Had a lot of fun chatting with Hamel H. and learning how to improve our evals with Windy (our Slack agent for Windmill) It’s relatively straightforward to get pretty good performance with LLMs, but achieving exceptional results is about 10x harder. Evals with LLM-as-a-Judge are going to help us make Windy amazing. I’ll report back here in a few weeks with an update., Multi-Turn Chat Evals – Hamel’s Blog, hamel.dev
