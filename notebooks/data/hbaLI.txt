AboutAbout
I'm an independent data and AI scientist, consultant, writer, educator & podcaster. My interests include promoting data & AI literacy/fluency, helping to spread data skills through organizations and society and lowering the barrier to entry for data science, analysis, and machine learning. Previously, I was Head of Developer Relations at Outerbounds, a company committed to building infrastructure that provides a solid foundation for machine learning applications of all shapes and sizes. I am also the host of the industry podcast Vanishing Gradients. I was previously Head of Marketing and Data Science Evangelism at Coiled, building solutions for scalable data science and machine learning in Python. Before this, I was at DataCamp, a data science training company educating over 4 million learners worldwide through interactive courses on the use of Python, R, SQL, Git, Bash and Spreadsheets in a data science context. While there, I spearheaded the development of over 25 courses in DataCamp’s Python curriculum, impacting over 250,000 learners worldwide through my own courses. I hosted and produced the data science podcast DataFramed, in which I used long-format interviews with working data scientists to delve into what actually happens in the space and what impact it can and does have.I'm an independent data and AI scientist, consultant, writer, educator & podcaster.

    🍿 While touring Europe, I want to chat with as many interesting people as possible and bring them to you. First up, meet Utkarsh Kashyap:

    * UK is a software engineer at Outerbounds working on ML/AI infrastructure tools for data scientists and ML/AI engineers 💻 
    * He loves building tools that delight users and enjoys the deep technical challenges that result here 💅 
    * He's excited about all the current challenges faced on the infra side by running and deploying LLMs and other foundational models 🤟 
    * Utkarsh also recently got married so many congrats to him and his wife! 💫 

    If you're at KubeCon EU this week, come say hi at Booth J26 and we can even record a short chat if you'd like! 📺 

PostPost
🇫🇷 Help us find the cat we’ve lost in Paris. Bring any leads to Outerbounds Booth J26 at KubeCon EU. Details in video 🐈 👇🏻

PostPost
🍿 I just caught up with Phillip Carter, Principal PM at honeycomb.io, at KubeCon EU in Paris 🥐 , who

* as Honeycomb's unofficial AI lead, was ONE OF THE FIRST PEOPLE TO PUT LLMS IN PRODUCTION 🤯 (outside of the big AI labs)! 🤓 
* loves solving problems that customers really care about and which there isn't such a playbook for; 💫 
* is excited about the possible futures of AI agents, with how good the models are getting, along with composability of models 🤖 

If you're at KubeCon EU or in Paris, London, Berlin, or Amsterdam (among other places in Europe) and want to chat, let me know! 📺

PostPost
🍿 I had the great pleasure of chatting with Gael Varoquaux, a co-founder/OG core dev of scikit-learn 😎 . Gaël

* Started scikit-learn, is a scientist at Inria, and is helping to spin out :probabl.! 🎲 
* Loves using science and software to contribute to the world in a good way, building tools that help others build technology and do science 😍 
* Is excited about better models for survival analysis and their applications in healthcare! 🏥 
* Is also excited about foundation models but concerned about the "bigger is better" worldview and its impact on climate change. 👀 

Gaël is a true legend to me and, although we've interacted over the years, we'd never met IRL, and it was such a pleasure! 🤩 

PostPost
scikit-learn is one of the most boring hashtag#machinelearning packages.

Let me tell you why while standing by the banks of the Seine eating a croissant 🥐 👇🏻

Also join our mixer with our scikit-learn friends at :probabl. tonight!

    ❓ Is Data Science Dead in the Age of AI ❓ In our latest High Signal episode, Hilary Mason shares why the answer is a resounding “No!”—but the field is undergoing profound changes. Automation is transforming workflows, generative AI is reshaping how problems are solved, and the community is moving beyond its “shiny” phase into something more mature. 💡 Fun fact: Hilary was my guest on the first podcast I ever released, nearly a decade ago. It’s amazing to see how much has changed—and how much has stayed the same. Key themes we covered: ✨ From Hype to Maturity Automation is redefining entry-level roles and workflows. What does this mean for the future of data science? 📜 Why Generative AI Needs Context, Not Prompts “Prompting feels like spellcasting, not engineering,” Hilary says. She explains how context-rich systems—like structured data and multimodal inputs—are the key to unlocking AI’s potential. ⏳ A Decade of Interfaces, Not Algorithms Even if machine learning progress stopped today, it would take years to design the workflows, tools, and interfaces needed to fully harness its power. 🎧 This episode, produced by Delphina with Duncan Gilchrist, dives deep into the evolving landscape of data science and what it takes to thrive in an AI-driven world.

            Hugo is amazing. I am a physician in NYC who is trying to learn more about DataScience. Hugo was my professor for DataScience as part of DataCamp. He is so incredibly articulate and passionate about Python. He made me feel like a true “pythonista”. I can’t say enough great things about him. He is obviously incredibly intelligent and has such deep knowledge of DataScience but also really helps the new student. I end my comment as I began: Hugo is simply amazing. Hugo is amazing.

            Hugo is one of these people I'm honored, thankful and humbled our paths crossed. I'm going to skip over Hugo's technical skills, not because they are not impressive (quite the contrary), but because they are the most obvious one. Hugo has an impressive education and a breathtaking academic background, and he's an incredibly skilled and renowned data scientist.

            At DataCamp, after designing our Python curriculum (that, at the date I'm writing, counts more than 130 courses and 40 projects), he applied his expertise as a data scientist and then created the DataFramed podcast, engaging in weekly conversations with major actors of the field (Cathy O'Neil, Wes McKinney), from leading organizations (AT&T, McKinsey), to thoroughly tackle questions around central topics (critical thinking, organizing teams, election forecasting) and tools (Jupyter, pandas). This podcast became one of, if not the leading podcast in data science, counting 60 episodes with an average of 4.9/5 on iTunes based on about 200 ratings.

            But all of this is public information. What is less known about Hugo is that his soft skills are just as, if not more, impressive as his hard skills. After doing research at some of the best academic organizations in the world (Yale, Max Planck Institute), he had a myriad of opportunities in front of him, that some of us could only dream of. Still, he chose to take a bet on a small startup, fresh out of Tech Stars 2015, coming in as employee #7. This company would end up raising more than $30 millions, hiring more than 100 collaborators, and becoming one of the leading names in data science education.

            Hugo hired the company's first Content Developer (Yashas Roy), who would end up leading the Content team, taking a bet on me, and being the best manager I ever had. When I was hired, I had been contracting as a support agent for 9 months: I was just creating issues on GitHub. The first time I met Hugo, he not only knew who I was but also how I had contributed so far, despite us never being in contact. Hugo was a driving force at DataCamp. His dedication, vision, hard work, intelligence and joyfulness have made it a delight to work alongside him. He has always acted as an advocate for the students and his colleagues, asking the hard questions and taking ownership of the solutions. It's been humbling and empowering to share a part of his journey. He will be dearly missed, but I'm very excited about what he will achieve next.

            When he left, Hugo confessed that, coming from an academic background, he originally had some doubts about his ability to deliver in the business world. Having gone through several business and management schools, I can without hesitation state that getting business students to come out of their school with half the vision, leadership, management, problem solving, productivity and team work skills (to name a few) that Hugo demonstrated would already be an incredible achievement.Hugo is one of these people I'm honored, thankful and humbled our paths crossed.
