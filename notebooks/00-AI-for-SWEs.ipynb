    "## Running the First App: Building an Index and Querying Documents\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we‚Äôll run our first simple generative AI app. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting Up Your Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we run the app, you'll need to set up your OpenAI API key. Follow these steps to ensure everything works smoothly:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Obtain Your OpenAI API Key**:\n",
    "   - Go to the [OpenAI website](https://platform.openai.com/signup) and sign up or log in to your account.\n",
    "   - Once logged in, generate an API key from the API settings page.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Export the API Key**:\n",
    "   - You‚Äôll need to export your API key as an environment variable. Use the following command in your terminal:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     export OPENAI_API_KEY=\"your_api_key_here\"\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Make sure to replace `\"your_api_key_here\"` with your actual OpenAI API key.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Verify Your Setup**:\n",
    "   - Check that your API key is correctly set by running:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     echo $OPENAI_API_KEY\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - This should print your API key if everything is set up correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have your API key configured, you‚Äôre ready to dive into running and interacting with the generative AI app!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We‚Äôll use the `llama_index` library to index a set of documents and then query them for information. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of what each line of the code does:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Load and Prepare the Documents**:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**: We import the necessary classes from `llama_index`. The `SimpleDirectoryReader` is used to load all documents from the `data` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal**: Load the data from your documents so that we can build an index for querying.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex, SimpleDirectoryReader\n",
    "documents = SimpleDirectoryReader(\"data\").load_data()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Create the Index**:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**: We create a `VectorStoreIndex` from the loaded documents. This index allows us to efficiently search through the documents using embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal**: Build an index that can handle search queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Set Up the Query Engine**:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**: We convert the index into a query engine. This engine will help us run natural language queries on our indexed documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal**: Prepare a query engine that can interpret and respond to user questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "query_engine = index.as_query_engine()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Query the Documents**:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**: We use the query engine to ask, ‚Äúwhat is o1,‚Äù and then print the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal**: See how the generative AI app responds to our question using the indexed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "response = query_engine.query(\"what is o1\")\n",
    "print(response)\n",

    "### Exercise: Personalize Your Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "We‚Äôll take this app a step further by making it more personal! Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôll do:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a Text File**: \n",
    "   - Copy and paste the content from your LinkedIn profile into a text file.\n",
    "   - Name the file something like `my_linkedin_profile.txt` and save it in the `data` directory.\n",
    "   - Make sure to include all the important details, such as your work experience, skills, and education.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Ask Questions About Yourself**: \n",
    "   - Once you‚Äôve added your LinkedIn content to the `data` directory, try running the app and ask questions about your own profile.\n",
    "   - For example, you could ask:\n",
    "     - \"What is my most recent job title?\"\n",
    "     - \"What skills do I have listed?\"\n",
    "     - \"Where did I go to university?\"\n",

    "![Simple RAG](img/0-simple-RAG.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We‚Äôll dive deeper into how this system works later on, but here's a quick overview of what you're looking at:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Structured and Unstructured Data**: We start with various types of data, like text documents or structured information.\n",
    "- **Chunking**: Data is broken down into manageable pieces, or \"chunks,\" to be processed.\n",
    "- **Vector DB (Embeddings)**: These chunks are then embedded using a text embedding model and stored in a vector database for efficient retrieval.\n",
    "- **Response Generation**: The system retrieves relevant chunks based on your query and uses a large language model to generate a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cool thing about this setup is that it abstracts away a lot of the complexity, such as embeddings, vector databases, and chunking. However, as we build and experiment, we need to be mindful of not getting stuck in **POC purgatory**‚Äîwhere we have a great proof-of-concept but never progress to a fully integrated, scalable solution.\n",

    "### Second Iteration: Adding a Front-End with Gradio\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we‚Äôve built the first version of our app, let‚Äôs make it more user-friendly by adding a front-end with **Gradio**. We‚Äôre also using **PyMuPDF** to handle PDF text extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt Text](img/1-gradio-fe.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What‚Äôs New in This Iteration**:\n",
    "- **Front-End with Gradio**: We‚Äôve added a simple Gradio interface that allows you to upload a PDF and ask questions about its contents.\n",
    "- **PDF Handling with PyMuPDF**: Instead of manually working with text, we can now extract text directly from PDFs, making the app more versatile.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Highlights:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Gradio Interface**: With just a few lines of code, we‚Äôve created a user-friendly interface:\n",
    "   - A **file upload** component to drag and drop your LinkedIn PDF.\n",
    "   - A **textbox** to type your questions.\n",
    "   - A **button** to submit your queries and get instant responses.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **Minimal Code, Maximum Impact**: \n",
    "   - The Gradio setup is simple yet powerful. It only takes a few lines of code to add an intuitive front-end to our app.\n",
    "   - This demonstrates how easily you can transform a backend script into an interactive AI-powered tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Task:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a PDF of Your LinkedIn Profile**:\n",
    "   - Open your LinkedIn profile.\n",
    "   - Click **Print** and then **Save as PDF** to generate a PDF.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **Upload and Query**:\n",
    "   - Use the Gradio interface to upload your LinkedIn PDF.\n",
    "   - Ask questions about your profile, like:\n",
    "     - \"What is my job title?\"\n",
    "     - \"What skills do I have listed?\"\n",
    "     - \"Where did I go to university?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise will help you understand how adding a simple front-end can make your AI app more engaging and accessible. Plus, you‚Äôll get to see the magic of querying your own profile in real time!\n",
    "\n",

    "### Third Iteration: Enhancing with Local Embeddings and Advanced LLM Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "In this version of our app, we‚Äôre taking things up a notch by:\n",
    "- Using **Hugging Face embeddings** for efficient, local text representation.\n",
    "- Incorporating the **Ollama API** to query the PDF with an advanced large language model like **LLaMA2**.\n",
    "\n",
    "These enhancements allow for more flexible and efficient querying, while still keeping the code approachable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's New in This Iteration?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Local Embeddings with Hugging Face**:\n",
    "   - We‚Äôre now specifying a local embedding model using `HuggingFaceEmbedding`. This gives us more control and flexibility while ensuring data privacy.\n",
    "   - The model we‚Äôre using, `\"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2\"`, is lightweight and suitable for many use cases, though it might not perform as well as proprietary models like OpenAI‚Äôs embeddings in terms of accuracy and nuance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Ollama API for LLaMA2**:\n",
    "   - We‚Äôve integrated the Ollama API to use **LLaMA2** as our language model, giving us more flexibility in handling complex queries.\n",
    "   - The Ollama integration makes it easy to configure and query the LLM with a simple interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Considerations for Self-Hosting**:\n",
    "   - You might think that you can just self-host the LLM and call it a day. However, there‚Äôs an important nuance: if you want to self-host the entire pipeline, you also need to set up your own **embedding model**.\n",
    "   - The OpenAI API does something clever: it seamlessly handles both the embedding and the generative task for you. When you switch to self-hosted models, you‚Äôre responsible for managing the embedding step and ensuring it integrates well with your LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Improved User Experience**:\n",
    "   - The app now handles edge cases to make sure it runs smoothly:\n",
    "     - **Ensuring a PDF is Uploaded**: This check is done in the `query_pdf` function:\n",
    "       ```python\n",
    "       if pdf is None:\n",
    "           return \"Please upload a PDF.\"\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "       This ensures that the user doesn‚Äôt proceed without uploading a file.\n",
    "     - **Validating the Query**: We also check that the query isn‚Äôt empty:\n",
    "       ```python\n",
    "       if not query.strip():\n",
    "           return \"Please enter a valid query.\"\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "       This makes sure the user provides a meaningful question before processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Highlights:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gradio Setup**: We continue to use Gradio to provide a clean and simple front-end.\n",
    "- **Embeddings and LLM**:\n",
    "  - We‚Äôre using **Hugging Face** for local embeddings, which brings benefits like:\n",
    "    - **Privacy**: Your data stays on your local machine.\n",
    "    - **Self-Hosting**: You‚Äôre not reliant on external APIs.\n",
    "    - **Cost Efficiency**: No need to pay for API calls to third-party services.\n",
    "  - **Trade-Off**: Performance may not be as strong as OpenAI‚Äôs models, and you need to manage more of the setup, like embedding models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Task:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Run the Code**: Execute the provided Python code to launch the enhanced version of the app.\n",
    "2. **Upload Your LinkedIn PDF**:\n",
    "   - Use the PDF you created earlier or generate a new one from your LinkedIn profile.\n",
    "3. **Ask More Complex Questions**:\n",
    "   - With these improvements, try asking more detailed or nuanced questions, such as:\n",
    "     - \"Summarize my professional background.\"\n",
    "     - \"List the programming languages I have experience with.\"\n",
    "     - \"What are the key highlights of my career?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experiment and Reflect:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Play Around with Queries**: Observe how the app handles your queries with the new embedding model and LLM integration. You may notice differences in performance compared to using proprietary APIs like OpenAI.\n",
    "- **Consider the Trade-offs**: Remember, self-hosting comes with more responsibilities. Setting up an LLM isn‚Äôt just about running the model‚Äîyou also need to handle embeddings, which OpenAI did seamlessly for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: If you‚Äôre curious about the full code, refer to the `3-app-local.py` file. Feel free to explore and modify it as you like!"

    "### Fourth Iteration: Introducing Conversational Interaction and Model Choice\n",
    "\n",
    "In this version, we‚Äôre adding a key feature: **conversational memory**. Now, you can have a back-and-forth conversation with the AI to refine your questions and get more precise answers. Additionally, you can choose between a local LLM (Ollama) or OpenAI for generating responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's New in This Iteration?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Conversational Memory**:\n",
    "   - The app now maintains a **conversation history**, so it can use context from previous questions to give more relevant answers.\n",
    "   - This is particularly useful when you need to ask follow-up questions or clarify information from the PDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Choice**:\n",
    "   - You can choose between two different models:\n",
    "     - **Local (Ollama)**: Uses a locally hosted model (like LLaMA2) for privacy and self-hosting.\n",
    "     - **OpenAI**: Uses OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-3.5-turbo, which might provide better performance for nuanced questions but requires an API key.\n",
    "   - The model selection is done through a simple **Gradio radio button** interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Highlights in the Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Conversation Handling**:\n",
    "   - The `query_pdf` function now takes a `history` parameter to keep track of the conversation.\n",
    "   - Previous interactions are included in the new query to provide context, making the conversation more coherent:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     conversation = \"\\n\".join([f\"User: {h[0]}\\nAssistant: {h[1]}\" for h in history])\n",
    "     conversation += f\"\\nUser: {query}\\n\"\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Selection**:\n",
    "   - You can choose between **Ollama** for a local model or **OpenAI** for a cloud-based option:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     if model_choice == \"Local (Ollama)\":\n",
    "         llm = Ollama(model=\"llama2\", request_timeout=60.0)\n",
    "     elif model_choice == \"OpenAI\":\n",
    "         openai_api_key = os.getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\")\n",
    "         llm = OpenAI(api_key=openai_api_key, model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\")\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Error Handling**:\n",
    "   - The app now catches exceptions and provides a friendly error message, helping you debug any issues:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     except Exception as e:\n",
    "         return [(\"An error occurred\", str(e))], history\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Task:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Run the Code**: Launch the app and experiment with having a conversation about your LinkedIn PDF.\n",
    "2. **Upload Your PDF**:\n",
    "   - Use the PDF you created earlier or generate a new one from your LinkedIn profile.\n",
    "3. **Ask Follow-Up Questions**:\n",
    "   - Start with a broad question and then ask more specific or clarifying follow-ups. For example:\n",
    "     - \"What are the main highlights of my professional experience?\"\n",
    "     - \"Can you elaborate on my skills related to data science?\"\n",
    "     - \"What is my educational background?\"\n",
    "4. **Switch Models**:\n",
    "   - Experiment with both the **Local (Ollama)** and **OpenAI** models to see how they handle your queries differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Performance Differences**: OpenAI‚Äôs model might perform better with complex, nuanced questions, but using it requires an API key and depends on an external service.\n",
    "- **Self-Hosting Trade-Offs**: The local Ollama model provides more privacy and control but might not be as robust or accurate as OpenAI‚Äôs offerings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This iteration brings your app closer to a conversational AI assistant, capable of refining its responses over multiple interactions. Feel free to test and see how well it handles different queries and models!\n",

    "### Fifth Iteration: Adding Logging and Observability\n",
    "\n",
    "In this version, we're focusing on **logging** every interaction to a local SQLite database to improve **observability** and **monitoring**. This feature helps us keep track of conversations, queries, and responses, which is essential for debugging, auditing, and improving the app.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's New in This Iteration?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Logging Conversations**:\n",
    "   - We‚Äôre now storing each conversation and message in a local SQLite database (`qa_traces.db`).\n",
    "   - Every interaction is logged, including the user's queries, the assistant's responses, and any system errors. This gives us a complete trace of each session.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Database Setup**:\n",
    "   - We use **SQLite** for simplicity and set up the database schema to store:\n",
    "     - **Conversations**: A record for each new conversation, with a unique `conversation_id` and a timestamp.\n",
    "     - **Messages**: Each message in the conversation, including its role (`user` or `assistant`), content, and timestamp.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Observability with Datasette**:\n",
    "   - We‚Äôll use **Simon Willison‚Äôs Datasette** to explore the conversation logs.\n",
    "   - Datasette is a powerful tool for inspecting and querying SQLite databases, making it easy to analyze and understand the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt Text](img/datasette_traces.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Highlights in the Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Thread-Local Database Connection**:\n",
    "   - We use `threading.local()` to ensure each thread has its own connection to the SQLite database:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     local = threading.local()\n",
    "     def get_db_connection():\n",

    "\n",
    "In this version, we're introducing a way to **evaluate** the AI's responses. Users can now provide feedback with a thumbs-up or thumbs-down, and this feedback is logged to our local SQLite database. This feature will help us measure and improve the quality of the app's responses over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's New in This Iteration?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Feedback Logging**:\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Handling Feedback Buttons**:\n",
    "   - Users can click **Thumbs-Up** or **Thumbs-Down** buttons to submit feedback:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     def handle_thumbs_up(message_id):\n",
    "         if message_id:\n",
    "             log_feedback(message_id, 1)  # Log thumbs-up as 1\n",

    "         return \"Feedback logged: üëé\"\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Gradio Interface**:\n",
    "   - We've added feedback buttons and a message to display the feedback status:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     thumbs_up_button = gr.Button(\"üëç\")\n",
    "     thumbs_down_button = gr.Button(\"üëé\")\n",

    "  - Discuss the differences between completion-based APIs and chat-based APIs, and when each is most appropriate.\n",
    "- **Non-Determinism**:\n",
    "  - Understand that generative models are inherently non-deterministic, meaning their responses can vary even with the same input. We'll talk about how to handle this in practice.\n",
    "- **What is an Embedding?**:\n",
    "  - Revisit embeddings and understand their role in representing textual data, especially for tasks like search, semantic similarity, and context-based querying.\n",

    "- **Character Setup**: The OpenAI client is configured to respond as Mario, while the Anthropic client replies in Yoda's distinctive speech style.\n",

    "- **System Prompts**: We explore how system prompts guide model behavior and help maintain character consistency throughout the conversation.\n",

This means that we, as developers, have to manage and provide the previous conversation context ourselves.\n",

By appending each user and assistant message to a `conversation_history` list, we can maintain a coherent and contextualized conversation.

    "## Prompt Templates\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will discuss **prompt templates**, which are structured formats designed to guide language models in generating specific types of outputs. By using templates, you can achieve more consistent and relevant results across various tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Use Prompt Templates?\n",
    "- **Improved Consistency**: Templates ensure that the responses adhere to a specific structure, which is crucial in fields like marketing, where maintaining a consistent brand voice is important.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Time Efficiency**: Templates allow for the reuse of formats, saving time on tasks such as drafting emails, creating reports, or generating social media posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Guidance for the Model**: Clear context and specific instructions within the template help the model produce more relevant and coherent outputs, especially in technical writing or documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Flexibility and Creativity**: While templates provide structure, they also allow for creative input. For example, in creative industries, templates can be used for brainstorming ideas while still providing a clear framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Output\n",
    "For instance, in a marketing context, a prompt template might be structured to generate engaging social media posts. You could define fields for the product, target audience, and key message. Given the inputs:\n",
    "- **Product**: Organic Coffee\n",
    "- **Target Audience**: Health-conscious consumers\n",
    "- **Key Message**: Sustainable sourcing\n",
    "\n",
    "The model might generate a post like: **\"Start your day with our Organic Coffee! Sustainably sourced and packed with flavor, it's the perfect choice for health-conscious consumers looking for a guilt-free boost.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "This illustrates how prompt templates can lead to clear, relevant, and engaging content tailored to specific needs. By employing prompt templates in your interactions with language models, you can streamline your content creation process and enhance the overall effectiveness of your communication efforts."

    "### Best Practices for Using Prompt Templates\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define Clear Objectives**: Understand the purpose of your prompts. Clearly defining what you want to achieve helps in crafting templates that are directly relevant to your goals, whether in marketing, storytelling, or data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Incorporate Flexibility**: Design your templates to allow for variation. Use open-ended phrases that encourage the model to generate diverse outputs while maintaining a clear direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use Specific Language**: Be explicit in the components of your templates. Instead of vague requests, specify details like the product type, target audience, and key messages. This precision helps the model focus on relevant content.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Test and Iterate**: After implementing your templates, test them with the model and review the outputs. Gather feedback to refine and improve the templates, enhancing their effectiveness over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Maintain Context**: Provide enough context in your templates to guide the model effectively. Context helps the model understand the tone, style, and audience, leading to more relevant outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Leverage Existing Templates**: Look for established templates relevant to your field. Adapting existing templates can save time and improve the quality of your generated content.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Combine Techniques**: Use templates in conjunction with other parameters, such as temperature and Top-P, to balance creativity and coherence. Adjusting these settings alongside your templates can yield more engaging and diverse outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these best practices, you can enhance your interactions with language models, leading to more consistent and effective results across various applications."

      "Interesting Facts about quantum mechanics: Quantum mechanics is a fascinating and complex field of physics that describes the behavior of matter and energy at very small scales, such as atoms and subatomic particles. Here are some interesting facts about quantum mechanics:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Wave-Particle Duality**: Particles, such as electrons and photons, exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties. This duality is famously illustrated by the double-slit experiment, where particles create an interference pattern when not observed, suggesting they behave like waves.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Quantum Superposition**: Particles can exist in multiple states at once until they are measured. This principle is exemplified by Schr√∂dinger's cat thought experiment, where a cat in a box is simultaneously alive and dead until someone opens the box and observes it.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Quantum Entanglement**: Particles can become entangled, meaning the state of one particle is directly related to the state of another, regardless of the distance between them. This phenomenon has been referred to by Einstein as \"spooky action at a distance.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**: This principle states that certain pairs of physical properties, like position and momentum, cannot be simultaneously measured with arbitrary precision. The more accurately you know one property, the less accurately you can know the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Quantization of Energy**: Energy levels in quantum systems are quantized, meaning particles can only exist in specific energy states. For example, electrons in an atom can only occupy certain energy levels and must absorb or emit discrete amounts of energy to transition between them.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Quantum Tunneling**: Particles have a probability of passing through potential barriers, even if they do not have enough energy to do so classically. This phenomenon is essential in processes like nuclear fusion and has practical applications in technologies like tunnel diodes and scanning tunneling microscopes.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Observer Effect**: The act of measurement affects the state of a quantum system. This is not just a limitation of measurement devices; it implies that the observer plays a crucial role in determining the outcome of quantum events.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Quantum Computing**: Quantum mechanics provides the foundation for quantum computers, which utilize qubits that can represent multiple states simultaneously, potentially allowing them to solve certain problems much faster than classical computers.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Bell's Theorem**: This theorem shows that no local hidden variable theory can reproduce all the predictions of quantum mechanics. Experiments confirming Bell's theorem suggest that entangled particles do not adhere to classical intuitions about locality and determinism.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Applications Beyond Physics**: Quantum mechanics underpins many modern technologies, including semiconductors, lasers, MRI machines, and even the principles behind quantum cryptography and secure communication.\n",
      "\n",
      "These facts highlight the counterintuitive and often perplexing nature of quantum mechanics, influencing not only our understanding of the physical world but also leading to groundbreaking technological advancements.\n"
