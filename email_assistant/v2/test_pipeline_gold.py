San Francisco, California, United States
Summary
With over 10 years of experience in building and leading data & ML related systems and teams, I am the co-founder and CEO of DAGWorks, a startup that helps data practitioners with a powerful and flexible framework based on Hamilton, an open source project that I co-created. I am also a Y Combinator alum, StartX alum, and a Stanford graduate with a Master of Science in Computer Science with Distinction in Research.
My passion is to make others more successful with data, by bridging the gap between data science, machine learning, engineering,
and business. I have expertise in data platforms, model lifecycles, featurization, and model serving systems, as well as in natural language processing, speech recognition, and spoken dialog systems. I am a proficient Python developer and a polymath engineer who can work with multiple languages and technologies.
I also contribute to open source projects and advise other startups
in the data space. I value good leadership, company culture, and innovation, and I strive to be a humble and effective leader who empowers and enables my team to solve challenging and interesting problems.
